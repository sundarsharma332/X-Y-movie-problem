# X-Y-movie-problem
A card Problem solved by nathon in the movie X+Y in python
I want to honor the movie "X plus Y" reproducing here one of his mathematical problems. Although I can not pose the problem with the fidelity it deserves I have implemented it so that it can be properly tested.

Original problem: "There are N cards in a row and they can be face up or face down. A turn consists of taking two adjacent cards where the left one is face up and the right one can be face up or face down and flipping them both. Show that this process terminates."

    You will be provided with a string of random length.

    A '1' represents card facing up. '0' represents cards facing down.

    A turn consists of taking two adjacent cards where the left one is face up and the right one can be face up or face down and flipping them both.

    If the only "1" that remains is the rightmost card, then just flip it on the final turn.

    Return the count of turns needed to turn all the cards facing down.

    Only strings containing 1's and 0's are valid.

    An invalid string should return 0 turns.

Enjoy the film if you can!
